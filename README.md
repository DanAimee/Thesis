# Thesis Project: Enzyme Kinetics with Machine Learning

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my thesis project! This project explores enzyme kinetics and parameter estimation using machine learning techniques, specifically applying NDEs and HMC Bayesian inference to enzymatic pathways. Below is an overview of the project, methodology, and structure of this repository.

Overview

Cleaning and scaling time-series NMR data.

Building and training Neural ODE models using the JAX-Catalax framework.

Conducting Bayesian inference via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) for parameter estimation.

Validating results using cross-validation and Monte Carlo simulations.
